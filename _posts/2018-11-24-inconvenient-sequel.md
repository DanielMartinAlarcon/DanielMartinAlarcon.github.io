I recreated this data visualization from FiveThirtyEight's article, [Al Goreâ€™s New Movie Exposes The Big Flaw In Online Movie Ratings](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/al-gores-new-movie-exposes-the-big-flaw-in-online-movie-ratings/).

By recreating this graph, I practiced:
- Pandas data wrangling and time sampling
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas plotting

You can see details, including code and comments, in [my Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/11GrAGqJCzAgjb9uS_GYPO7n1qmaLlB3l).
