A few years ago, the Tanzanian Ministry of Water conducted a survey of tens of thousands of water pumps that had been installed around the country over the years.  The Ministry knew what kind of pumps existed, which organizations had installed them, and how they were managed.  The survey added one last important detail to the existing knowledge: did the pumps still work?  

The Ministry's data about the pumps and their status was collected into a dataset and organized into a competition by [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/), a platform that organizes data science competitions around problems with 
humanitarian impact.  Predictive analytics on this dataset could allow the Ministry to know in advance which pumps are most likely to be non-functional, so that they can triage their repair efforts.  It's hard to find much simpler examples of how a good predictive model can directly save time and money.

I tackled this dataset during my time at Lambda School, and [wrote it up as a Kaggle Kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/danielmartinalarcon/tanzanian-water-pumps/). It remains my go-to example for what it means to deal with the messy and inconsistent records that much of the world is built on.
