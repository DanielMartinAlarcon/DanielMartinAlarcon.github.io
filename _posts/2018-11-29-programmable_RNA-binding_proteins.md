Much of modern bioengineering is based on tools that bind to important biomolecules and execute some useful behavior, preferably in living organisms. The most famous biotechnology of the last decade, [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR), is based on a protein-RNA combination that can bind to (and therefore edit) specific sequences of DNA in the genome of basically anything.

While most research has focused on binding to DNA, there also exists an alternative approach focused on binding to the secondary genetic messenger, Ribonucleic Acid or RNA. Pumby is a programmable protein designed to bind arbitrary sequences of RNA in living mammalian cells.

While the full methods and results of this project was [published in PNAS in 2016](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/04/25/1519368113), this post is dedicated solely to the rationale behind the project and the most interesting applications that we envisioned for this new technology.
