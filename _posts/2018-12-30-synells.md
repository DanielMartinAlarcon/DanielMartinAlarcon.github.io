![Synells overview](/img/5_synells/synell1.png)

Synthetic minimal cells (synells) are microscopic bioreactors that allow scientists to study many of the molecules and processes of life. These artificial cells are built from the same materials as living cells (proteins and small molecules, encased in a phospholipid [liposome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liposome)). But unlike regular cells, synells can be built to spec.

Scientists use synells to figure out how cells do what they do. Because they are built from scratch and don't have to contain _all_ the elements necessary for life, synells can isolate particular parts of biology that we are interested in studying. The synells we used in this paper, for example, contained the transcription/translation machinery (the hardware) from bacterial and mammalian cells, but none of the original DNA from those cells (the software).

Our project was an exploration of biological programming. We took internal hardware from living systems, added our own custom software (DNA that we designed and synthesized), and measured the outputs of our genetic programs. Previous research had done these experiments in test tubes or single liposomes. Our contribution is to show the versatility that comes from using liposomes to compartmentalize the various elements of a genetic circuit. 

Synells were part of my PhD thesis work, carried out in [Ed Boyden's group at the MIT Media Lab](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/). You can always read the full published paper [Nature Chemistry copy](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchem.2644.html); [local copy](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/PDFs/16.11.adamala.pdf)), but I believe that every good paper deserves an informal recap of what the project was about and why it is interesting. That is what you'll find here.
