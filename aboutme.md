title: About me
---

I help life scientists whose research produced more data than they expected.  I turn raw measurements into insights, graphs, and impactful publications.  I have worked at all stages of the life sciences pipeline, with previous specialization in statistical analysis and grant writing. 

I have a PhD in Bioengineering from the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).  My PhD work with [Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/) focused on artificial life.  I created [programmable RNA-binding proteins](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/249/25) and new ways of designing genetic circuits using [Synthetic Minimal Cells](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/258/25).
