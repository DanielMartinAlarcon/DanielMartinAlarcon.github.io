Hi, I'm Daniel.  I'm a data scientist and bioengineer living in San Francisco.  I have worked at all stages of the life sciences pipeline, with previous specialization in statistical analysis and grant writing.  

I have a PhD in Bioengineering from the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).  My PhD work with [Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/) focused on artificial life.  I created [programmable RNA-binding proteins](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/249/25) and new ways of designing genetic circuits using [Synthetic Minimal Cells](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/258/25).

You can reach me by emailing [firstname] [at] [lastname].org (same domain as this website).
