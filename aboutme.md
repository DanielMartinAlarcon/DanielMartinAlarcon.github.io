title: About Me
---

I'm Daniel, a data scientist and bioengineer based in San Francisco. I have a PhD in Bioengineering from the [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/).  My graduate work with [Ed Boyden](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/) focused on making molecular tools for neuroscience research.  I created [programmable RNA-binding proteins](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/249/25) and new ways of designing genetic circuits using [Synthetic Minimal Cells](http://syntheticneurobiology.org/publications/publicationdetail/258/25).

These days my focus is on machine learning.
