I recreated [ this data visualization from Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/downloads/updated-gapminder-world-poster-2015/).

By recreating this graph, I practiced:
- Pandas data wrangling
- Matplotlib and Seaborn plotting

You can see details, including code and comments, in [my Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FZGiMct_TBBtg3h2B-gGe387nUfPqu8I).
